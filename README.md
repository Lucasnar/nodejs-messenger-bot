# Simple test bot for Facebok Messenger.

This is a simple bot made for Facebook Messenger. I am just playing with it to learn more about the Facebook API.
I am using NodeJS and the following client to access the API: https://github.com/remixz/messenger-bot.

I intend to post a short tutorial on how to run this app (and any Facebook app) soon.

Should you have any questions, contact me at lucasnar@gmail.com.
